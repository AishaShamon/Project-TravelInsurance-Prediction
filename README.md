#### Overview
#### What is TravelInsurance Prediction?
The task of insurance prediction is something that adds value to every insurance company. They use data from their database about everyone they have contacted to promote their insurance services and try to find the most potential people who can buy insurance. This helps a company to target the most profitable customers and saves time and money for the Insurance Company.

In the section below, I will take you through the task of Insurance Prediction with Machine Learning using Python. For the task of Insurance prediction with machine learning, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle about the previous customers of a travel insurance company. Here our task is to train a machine learning model to predict whether an individual will purchase the insurance policy from the company or not.

#### Dataset :

### Problem Statement:
The task of insurance prediction is something that adds value to every insurance company. They use data from their database about everyone they have contacted to promote their insurance services and try to find the most potential people who can buy insurance.

 Travel insurence prediction model implementation, and performance evaluation are conducted with pre-processing.

####   Build a model to  perform the task of Insurance Prediction with Machine Learning using Python
### Implementation:
##### Libraries: - NumPy
- pandas 
- sklearn
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
###  Structure:
- Part 1 : Importing Libraries
- Part 2 : Reading and Preparing the dataset
- Part 3 : Exploring the data
- Part 4 : Cleaning the data
- Part 5 : Extracting the data
- Part 6 : Visualizing the data
- Part 7 : Creating a model
- Part 8 : Conclusion
 ### Observation
- This EDA will give some use useful insights to built a suitable model for Travelinsurance using Age, Employment Type, GraduateOrNot, AnnualIncome,FamilyMembers, ChronicDiseases, FrequentFlyer, EverTravelledAbroad.

### Applying some machine learning models:
 Here our aim is to create a model that helps the users to apply machine learning approach to predict the potential people who can buy insurance . Here, the models used are:

- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost




### Comparison of all Models:

| Model | Accuracy Percentage | 
| --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 65% |
| RandomForestClassifier | 80% |
| DecisionTreeClassifier | 79% |
| KNN | 82% |
| XGB | 83% |

## Conclusion:


###### XGBoost Classifier is best amoung the model with an accuracy score of 83%
